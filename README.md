# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **13** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

Summery: Found an exploit in the list of sales persons that allowed me to add a sequal injection to the end of the url and effect the database. I used a sleep command to check to see if it worked and it did because the page would wait for the reponse the amount of time passed in the Sleep() command.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Summary: Found the exploit in session hijacking by finding the sessionID in the cookies of a logged in user. From there I opened the webpage in a different browser and went to the page and used the given extensions in the problem description to get the change session ID page. I inspected the logged in page copied the cookie value for session ID and inserted in the change session ID page and was successfully able to hijack the session.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Summary: I was able to successfully find the XSS vulernability by submiting feed back with a malicious script in it. When the admin opened the page with various feedback posts the site would show an alert.

Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration

Summary: Found the username enumeration vulnerability by going to the login page. At the login page if you log in with a existing username and wrong password the error message will be bold. If you log in with a non-existing username and wrong password the error message will be regular font.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Summary: Found the Insecure Direct Object Reference vulnerability in the Sales persons list. The id feature of each sales person is insecurly reference in the url allowing people to change the ID directly from the URL

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Summary: For this vulnerability I had to copy the form in the edit salesperson page. I turned it into an html file which when executed would completely change the data regarding the user with the following id in the header i chose to put in the link to my script. I pasted the link in the contact us page so then when an admin went to the link it would end up having him change the data him/herself.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work:
The most challenging thing I eperience during this assignment was determining what was actually a vulnerability. FOr example the username enumeration I did not realize what is was viewing was a vulnerability.
